1. [Beej's Guide to C Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgc/html/): an extremely
comprehensive guide to C programming. I thought I knew C very well, and I still
learned a lot reading through this.

2. [Float Exposed](https://float.exposed/0x07dce3e9): a tool which visualizes
the bit-representation of floating point numbers. Extremely useful for getting
an intuitive understanding.

3. [Terms of Service; Didn't Read](https://tosdr.org/en): "“Terms of Service;
Didn't Read” (short: ToS;DR) is a young project started in June 2012 to help
fix the “biggest lie on the web”: almost no one really reads the terms of
service we agree to all the time."
