**What is a uses page?**

I'm not sure of the ultimate provenance; but in my mind `/uses` was popularized
by [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/). The idea is to tell people about the tools,
software or otherwise, that you make use of. This can be in a professional capacity,
for productivity generally, or just for enjoyment.
